# Read Me for my Main Github Website

### B3x0r.github.io</h3>

#### Description:

This started as a week 1 assignment to get familiar with GitHub. The first version just had a **header** and a *selfie*. Now, it is a website to show off my coding skills.

#### Installation:

You can just copy **B3x0r.github.io** into a browser and paste it into the url line.

#### Usage:

For now, it is a place to learn more about me and my coding.

#### Support: 

I don't forsee you needing support at this point.

#### Roadmap: 

I plan on keeping this site up to date with current examples of my work.

Please don't use my photo. I took it, I grew the bush behind me, and the photo is of me. It just seems weird that you would have a reason to use my photo. All rights reserved.

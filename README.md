This was a week 1 assignment to get familar with GitHub. It's not much, but I hope to ***go back and flush it out*** some more. This first version just has a **header** and a *selfie*.

######Installation:

You can just copy **B3x0r.github.io** into a browser and paste it into the url line.

######Usage:

For now, it is just a place to see my selfie in front of a butterfly bush.

######Support: 

I don't forsee you needing support at this point.

######Roadmap: 

Eventually, this will be a website you can learn more about me.

######License information:

Please don't use my photo. I took it, I grew the bush behind me, and the photo is of me. I just seems weird that you would have a reason to use my photo. All rights reserved.
